title: Wicket 1.4.1 released
---

The Apache Wicket project is proud to announce the first maintenance release
of Apache Wicket 1.4.

### Download Apache Wicket 1.4

You can download the release here:
[http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/wicket/1.4.1](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/wicket/1.4.1)

Or use this in your Maven pom's to upgrade to the new version:

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.1</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

### Changes

The most notable change in this release is the transparent support for
multipart form submissions via Ajax. Wicket is now smart enough to submit a
form using a hidden iframe rather then the standard XMLHttpRequest if the
form contains file upload fields.

A complete list of changes can be found in our
[Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&mode=hide&sorter/order=DESC&sorter/field=priority&pid=12310561&fixfor=12314113)
instance.

We thank you for your patience and support.

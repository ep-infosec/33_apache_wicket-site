Pro Wicket, written by by Karthik Gurumurthy, is the first book about Wicket,
and covers Wicket 1.2. It was published by Apress in September 2006.

## Description ##

Wicket is an open source, component-oriented (POJOs-based), lightweight Java
web application development framework that brings the Java Swing event-based
programming model to web development. Wicket pages can be mocked up,
previewed, and later revised using standard WYSIWYG HTML design tools.

Wicket provides stateful components, thereby improving productivity. It has an
architecture and rich component suite that aims to bring back the object
orientation and, more importantly, the fun that is missing from the Java web
development space. With the impending 1.2 release, Wicket is set for wider
adoption.

Pro Wicket gets you up and running quickly with this framework. You'll learn
how to configure Wicket, then gradually gain exposure to the "Wicket way" of
addressing web development requirements. You'll want to pick up a copy because

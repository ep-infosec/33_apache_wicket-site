---

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Wicket 1.5.10 and 6.13.0

Description:

By issuing requests to special urls handled by Wicket it is possible to check for the existence of particular classes in the classpath and thus check whether a third party library with a known security vulnerability is in use.

The application developers are recommended to upgrade to: 
- [Apache Wicket 1.5.11](/news/2014/02/06/wicket-1.5.11-released.html)
- [Apache Wicket 6.14.0](/news/2014/02/20/wicket-6.14.0-released.html)

title: CVE-2015-5347 Apache Wicket XSS vulnerability
---

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Wicket 1.5.x, 6.x and 7.x

Description:

It is possible for JavaScript statements to break out of a ModalWindow's 
title - only quotes are escaped in the JavaScript settings object, allowing JavaScript
to be injected into the markup.

This might pose a security threat if the written JavaScript contains user provided data.

The title is now escaped by default, this can be disabled explicitly via
  modalWindow.setEscapeModelStrings(false).

## The application developers are recommended to upgrade to: 
    
* [Apache Wicket 1.5.15](/news/2016/02/19/wicket-1.5.15-released.html)
* [Apache Wicket 6.22.0](/news/2016/02/19/wicket-6.22.0-released.html)
* [Apache Wicket 7.2.0](/news/2016/01/20/wicket-7.2.0-released.html)

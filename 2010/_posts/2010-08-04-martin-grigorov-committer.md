The Apache Wicket team is proud to have Martin Grigorov as a new member to the
team of developers. Martin has provided many high quality patches and didn't
just pick the easy bugs either. He's also very active on the user list and
contributes to several [Wicket Stuff projects](http://wicketstuff.org).

Welcome Martin!

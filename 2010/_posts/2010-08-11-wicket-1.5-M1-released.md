title: Wicket 1.5-M1 released
---

This is the first milestone of the new 1.5.x Wicket series. The focus of 1.5.x is to 
provide our users with a more powerful and flexible request processing pipeline.

This release is NOT production-ready, it is more of a technology demo that should facilitate user-feedback we can fold into the next milestone.

title: Wicket 1.5-M2.1 released
---

This is the second milestone of the new 1.5.x Wicket series. The focus of 1.5.x is to 
provide our users with a more powerful and flexible request processing pipeline.

This release is NOT production-ready, it is more of a technology demo that should facilitate user-feedback we can fold into the next milestone.

New and noteworthy items in this milestone include [Inter-component event mechanism](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WICKET/Migration+to+Wicket+1.5#MigrationtoWicket1.5-Intercomponentevents) which allows components to communicate in a decoupled fashion, and improved [resource caching](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WICKET/Migration+to+Wicket+1.5#MigrationtoWicket1.5-getResourceSettings%2528%2529.setAddLastModifiedTimeToResourceReferenceUrl%2528%2529hasbeenreplaced).

title: CVE-2012-1089 - Apache Wicket serving of hidden files vulnerability
---

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Wicket 1.4.x and 1.5.x

Description:
It is possible to view the content of any file of a web application by
using an Url to a Wicket resource which resolves to a 'null' package.
With such a Url the attacker can request the content of any file by specifying
its relative path, i.e. the attacker must know the file name to be able to
request it.

Mitigation:
Setup a custom org.apache.wicket.markup.html.IPackageResourceGuard that provides
a whitelist of allowed resources.
Since versions 1.4.20 and 1.5.5 Apache Wicket uses by default
org.apache.wicket.markup.html.SecurePackageResourceGuard with a preconfigured
list of allowed file extensions.
Either setup SecurePackageResourceGuard with code like:

{% highlight java %}
public class MyApp extends WebApplication {
    public void init() {
        super.init();
        SecurePackageResourceGuard guard = new SecurePackageResourceGuard();
        guard.addPattern(...);
        guard.addPattern(...);
        getResourceSettings().setPackageResourceGuard(guard);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

or upgrade [Apache Wicket 1.4.20](http://wicket.apache.org/news/2012/03/12/wicket-1.4.20-released.html) or
[Apache Wicket 1.5.5](http://wicket.apache.org/news/2012/03/12/wicket-1.5.5-released.html)

The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance in
eliminating security problems against the Apache Wicket web framework.

For reporting and discussing a security issue you should contact the
Wicket PMC privately. 

**\*\* PLEASE DO NOT CREATE A SECURITY REPORT IN OUR ISSUE TRACKER \*\***

The issue tracker for Wicket is not the appropriate venue for reporting
security issues as the issue tracker is publicly accessible. Instead,
contact the Wicket PMC privately.

### Contact the Wicket PMC privately

Send your security issue to **private at wicket.apache.org**. This list
is not publicly available so we can discuss and fix the issue in
private without leaking the info to any bad guys.

<a class="button" href="#" onclick="window.location.href='mailto:private@wicket.apache.org?subject=Security%20issue';return false;" href="mailto:private@wicket.apache.org?subject=Security%20issue">
    <i class="fa fa-shield"></i>
    REPORT A SECURITY ISSUE
</a>

We treat all security issues seriously and will try to fix them as soon
as possible in all affected versions that we still support.

### Report normal bugs in JIRA

The Security Team cannot accept regular bug reports or other queries,
we ask that you use our [bug reporting page]({{site.baseurl}}/help/#reportbug)
for normal, non-security bugs.
